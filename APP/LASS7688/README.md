## How to install the codes (for new LinkIt Smart 7688 boards)?

Please login your 7688 board, and switch your 7688 to station mode (note: the other choice is to turn off WiFi and enable Ethernet connection). Then, please change the working directory to /root and follow the following steps:

1. Use the coommand to get the latest version of the codes: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/winshareinc/AnySense_7688

2. update the values of GPS_LAT and GPS_LON with your GPS coordinates in the file /root/AnySense_7688/APP_LASS7688_config.py

3. Run the setup script:
   ```
   /root/AnySense_7688/APP/LASS7688/setup.sh

Then, the script will install and configure everything. The system will reboot after the installation is done, and hopefully the system will start to upload data to the backend database.

## How to re-install the codes?

Please use the designated account/password to login the system, and remove the existing project source codes:
